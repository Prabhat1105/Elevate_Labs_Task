I completed Task 7 by reviewing all browser extensions installed on my system using Chrome's extension manager. 
After checking each extensionâ€™s permissions, developer credibility, and user reviews, I found no suspicious or unnecessary extensions. 
This task helped me understand how browser extensions can pose security risks, such as stealing data or affecting performance, and taught me best practices for managing them safely.
