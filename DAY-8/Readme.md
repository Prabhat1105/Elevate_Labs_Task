This repository documents the completion of Task 8 from the Cyber Security Internship program, which focuses on exploring the role of VPNs in enhancing online privacy and securing communication. 
Using ProtonVPNâ€™s free tier, I successfully configured a VPN connection, verified IP address changes, and tested encrypted browsing to understand how VPNs mask user identity and protect data in transit. 
The task includes a detailed report outlining the VPN setup process, screenshots confirming connection status, and a concise analysis of VPN benefits, limitations, and encryption protocols.
This hands-on exercise deepened my understanding of network security concepts such as tunneling, anonymity, and performance trade-offs.
While also reinforcing the importance of identifying and removing suspicious browser extensions to maintain a secure browsing environment.
