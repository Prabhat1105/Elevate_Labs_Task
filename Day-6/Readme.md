In this task, I explored password security by creating and testing multiple passwords using online strength checkers. 
I observed that passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and sufficient length are significantly stronger and more secure. 
Simple or commonly used passwords were rated weak and vulnerable to brute force and dictionary attacks.
Passphrases proved to be both secure and easy to remember. 
I also learned about best practices for password creation and the importance of multi-factor authentication and password managers in enhancing overall security.
