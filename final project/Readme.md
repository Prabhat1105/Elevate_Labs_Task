SQL Injection Playground â€” a small, educational project demonstrating SQL injection vulnerabilities and basic detection. 
It includes a deliberately vulnerable Flask app (`/search`, `/login`), a secure counterpart using parameterized queries, and a simple Python detector that probes endpoints with common SQLi payloads and logs results.
Use only in controlled, authorized environments for learning and testing.
