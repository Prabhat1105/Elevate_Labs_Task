In this task, I used Wireshark inside a VirtualBox virtual machine to capture and analyze live network traffic. 
After setting up the environment, I started capturing packets on the active network interface while browsing websites and pinging servers to generate traffic. 
I stopped the capture after a minute and applied filters to identify protocols such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP. 
The capture was exported as a .pcap file, and I summarized my findings in a short report.
